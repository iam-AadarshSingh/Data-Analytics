# Data Analytics With Aadarsh
<p>It is a 26 week Data Analytics learning series, where I am going to learn and share my learnings to you. Any piece of suggestion, and support is highly appriciated. 
You can find it on my LinkedIn too. As step by step I will proceed in the course I will also upload the code, all codes are numbered means are in a series so you do not need to be confused. To run the code you need python and annaconda. Download links are below. </br>

## Week 0
<p>Week 0 is the basicaly a starting point, Here is no learning activity in week 0. :) </br>

## Week 1
<p>Just gone through the short details and topics, which is going to be covered in upcoming weeks. We are going to cover here Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, APIs, Pandas, Seaborn etc.</p>

## Week 2
<p>learned about relevant terms such as Business, Data(Qualitative data & Quantitative Data), Analysis, Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Science, Job role, and why we are using python to learn DA.</br>
‚úÖ Business - An organization that exists to make money. </br>
‚úÖ Data - Information gathered for reference . There are two types of data -</br> 
 1 - Qualitative Data - Comes in the form of text and is descriptive in mature. It does not contain numbers. Does not provide a precise specification. Ex- Customer Feedback, A business case study.</br>
 2 - Quantitative Data - Contains number. Quantifiable information that can be involved in statistical and mathematical computation. Ex - number of products produced in last 12 months.</br> 
‚úÖ Analysis - Analysis is separation of the whole data into smaller components to be studied individually. Analysis always contain past data. Ex - Business  Analysis(Past performance of any business)</br>
‚úÖ Analytics - Analytics consist of analysis and logical computational reasoning. In analytics, analyst explore a pattern in data that help to predict future along with having insights over the past performance.</br>
‚úÖ Business Intelligence - BI studies past of the company and comprises several activities , including business and data analytics.</br>
‚úÖ Data Science - Along with business analysis and data analysis often involves the implementation of machine learning algorithms.</br> 
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What a DA do - 
A DA gathers data and make it use of available information to improve the organization performance.</br>
‚ùì Why we use Python - 
Python is most used language in DA because of its rich features, extrema reliability, large area of applicability. As python is a open source, general purpose, high level programming language</p>

## Week 3
<p>learned about Program, Programming, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, and Jupyter shortcuts.</br>
‚úÖProgram - Is a sequence of instructions that written to execute a computation.</br>
‚úÖProgramming - is writing a task in a language that the computer can understand and execute.</br>
‚úÖJupyter - is a server client application that allows to edit code through web browser. It comes with Python kernels, where other kernels can also be installed.</br>

  </tr>
</table>
‚úÖMarkdown Cell - A cell that contains strictly documentation text<p/>

## Week 4
<p>learned about Python variables, Python data types, Python operator, Python line continuation, Python indexing, Python conditionals, Python fuction with some built in function, Python sequence along with methods, slicing, Tuple, Dictonaries and, Python loops.

‚úÖPython variables - No need to define data type. </br>
 x, y = 1, 2.15</br> 
‚úÖtype() Function - Returns type of the variable.</br>
 type(x), type(y), type(2.15)</br>
‚úÖOperators - Arithmetic Operator(+,-,/,%,*,**), Comparison Operator(==,!=,>,<,<=,>=), Logical(and, not, or) and Identity(is(==), is not(!==)) Operator. </br>
‚úÖReassign Values in Python - In this process of reassigning the value the last command will be valid and all older commands are overwritten.</br>
 <pre>
 a = 1
 print(a)
 a = 3
 print(a)</pre>
‚úÖComments in Python - # is used to write single line comment in Python. </br>
 #This is s comment</br>
‚úÖLine Continuation - We can write single line command in multiple lines using \. </br>
<pre> 3+4+8+6+9+7+8+9 
 or
 3+4+8+6+\
 9+7+8+9</pre>
‚úÖConditional - </br>
 1 - if Condition</br>
 2 - if-else Condition</br>
 3 - elif statement </br>
‚úÖFunction - def keyword is used to create a function in python.</br>
‚úÖLists - A list is a type of sequence of data such as integer, floats, and strings. Lists are mutable. </br>
 name_of_list[elements]</br>
‚úÖTuples - Tuples are immutable. Tuples elements are placed within parentheses.</br>
 name_of_tuple(elements)</br>
‚úÖDictionaries - In dictionaries data are stored in the form of key value pair. Dictionary elements are placed within curly braces.</br>
 name_of_dictionary{key_1:value_1,.................., key_n:value_n} </br>
‚úÖLoops - There are two types of loop in python.</br>
 1 - for loop</br>
 2 - while loop</br>
</p>
